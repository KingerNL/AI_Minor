    "Dit doen we door middel van onze image door het model te halen, te kijken hoe erg het lijkt op een toaster, en zo de image aan te passen dat het bij de 2e keer door het model heen halen meer lijkt om een toaster. Als we dit de hele tijd blijven doen komt er op een gegeven moment een foto uit die erg lijkt op een toaster volgens het model, maar in realiteit misschien iets veel anders is. Maar hoe weten we nou zeker dat de afbeelding niet super erg verranderd in de tussentijd? \n",

    "En dit doen we eigenlijk in een loop, we veranderen dus de hele tijd waarde in de afbeelding zodat het model denkt dat het lijkt een broodrooster, maar voor ons nog steeds lijkt op een kat.
